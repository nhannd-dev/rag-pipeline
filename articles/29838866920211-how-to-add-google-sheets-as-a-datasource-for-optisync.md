**Synchronization**

- **Only import once:** This option imports the data only once when you add the DataSource. After the initial import, the data will not be updated automatically.
- **Periodic direct access:** This option regularly fetches the latest data directly from the device through your gateway, providing "live access" to the data and ensuring you have the most up-to-date information available directly from the device.
  - *This is better for more consistent update intervals, but could cause performance issues.*
- **Periodic background sync:** This option periodically syncs data to your server in the background at regular intervals, reducing the need for direct queries to the device.

| **IMPORTANT** |
| --- |
| OptiSync does not support special characters (i.e. anything outside the scope of an English-language keyboard). This will cause the system data to read as blank, and it will not show. |

**Update Interval**

*The duration of time between updates if you chose "Periodic direct access" or "Periodic background sync"*

- None *(Your Datasource will import with the newest data available, but will not continuously update afterward. You will have to force refresh data for new updates.)*
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- 8 hours
