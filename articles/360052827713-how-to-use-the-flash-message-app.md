- Flash Assets, Playlists, or a Simple Message on your screens
- Flash immediately, or schedule when and how long your flash message should last

| **USE CASE** |
| --- |
| In a car dealership service waiting room, you could have your normal marketing playlist playing most of the time. When a customer's car is ready, the Flash Message app can interrupt the playlist with a message like: "Mr. Joe, your car is ready!" on the screens for a moment. Then, return to playing the normal playlist. |
