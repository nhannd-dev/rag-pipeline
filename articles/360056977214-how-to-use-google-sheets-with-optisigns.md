## Limitations

- **Update Intervals:**
  - **Private Sheet:**Google will notify our system when you update your Sheet, and we will reload the information in as little as 5 minutes, up to one hour (or whenever you set your Force Sync Interval).
  - **Published Sheet:** Google updates the webpage automatically every 5 minutes. Your screens should then update in around 5-10 minutes, up to the Force Sync interval (minimum 1 hour).
- **Hidden Sheet:** If you try to import a hidden Sheet, we will not be able to access the content. This will cause the Preview window or Screens to display as black.
- **Custom Display Region:**
  - Currently, it is only supported for Private Sheet.
  - This must be set up during the creation of the asset. Once this is selected for an asset, it cannot be unselected. Or, if you do not select it upon creating the asset, you cannot select it later.
  - If you set up Custom Display Region, you can always adjust the inputted cells and scaling.
