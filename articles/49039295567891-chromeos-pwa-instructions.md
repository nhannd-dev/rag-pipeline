Chrome boxes are common for large-scale digital signage deployment as there are industrial-grade chrome boxes such as [AOpen Chromebox Commercial 3](https://www.aopen.com/us_en/products_info/Chromebox_Commercial_3/).

Chrome devices are very stable, and provide excellent performance, they can also be managed by Google Chrome Device Management which will simplify your large-scale deployment, ensure enterprise security, and reduce device management overhead. You can learn more about Google's ChromeOS device management [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1289314?hl=en#:~:text=Enforce%20policies%20and%20manage%20apps&text=You%20can%20make%20Wi%2DFi,Manage%20policies%20for%20Chrome%20devices.).

Displaying OptiSigns on a ChromeOS device consists of these broad steps:

1. Adding OptiSigns Player to your Google Admin account
2. Adding the OptiSigns Player app as an extension
3. Mass Provisioning devices (optional)
4. Pushing Content to Your ChromeOS Device

## Adding the OptiSigns Player App as an Extension

Now that OptiSigns is registered, we need to add it as an extension. Click on the **OptiSigns row**, then in the side panel go to the **Extensions** section and click **Add Extension**.

Technically, your ChromeOS devices are now configured, and can be treated like any other screen in OptiSigns.

If mass-provisioning, keep reading. If not, you can follow our [**Getting Started**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/18823504383891-OptiSigns-Getting-Started-Guide)guide to pair the device in OptiSigns, upload content, then get your displays working!

<a id="MassProvisioning"></a>

## Mass Provisioning on ChromeOS Devices (optional)

Mass provisioning requires two steps:

1. Creating a mass provisioning template on the OptiSigns Portal
2. Adding the JSON of that template into your Policy for Extensions area in Google Admin

<a id="Creating"></a>

### Creating a Mass Provisioning Template on OptiSigns

To create a provisioning template, go to the OptiSigns portal and go to the account menu at the top right of the portal: **Username** → **More** → **Provisioning Templates**.

![provisioning templates](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/50218184695315)

Hit **Create New Provisioning Template:**

![optisigns create provisioning template](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49041868805267)

You'll be asked to set up the template.

![provisioning template creation window](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039280054419)

- **Template Name**: Name of your template, this is for you to distinguish it when you have multiple provisioning templates.
- **Device Name Prefix**: This is used to generate the device name during provisioning.
- **Device Name Suffix**: This is used to generate the device name during provisioning, the default setting will add timestamps as a suffix.
- **Folder**: The folder that provisioned devices are added to.
- **Wi-Fi**: Select from the stored Wi-Fi, need to be created first. Only required if you want to setup WIFI during provisioning. Wi-Fi setup is normally not needed for ChromeOS deployment, since the deployment will be managed in the Google Admin console.
- **Time Zone**: Specify the time zone of the device.
- **Tags**: Specify the tags you want to associate to the devices.
- **Initial Default Content Type**: Used to set the initial content on the device after provisioning.
- **Orientation**: Set the orientation, landscape is the default.
- **Sync Play**: Turns Sync Play on or off. See [Synchronized playback (Sync Play)](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412065189267-Synchronized-playback-Sync-Play-feature) for more information.
- **Location**: Set the location of the device.

#### Advanced

![advanced creation window](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039280055571)

- **If device already paired**: Provides options for devices which have already been paired in OptiSigns and how to handle that:
  - **Add Wifi only**: Adds the additional Wi-Fi as an option and leaves other configurations alone.
  - **Replace Wifi only:** Replaces the Wi-Fi configuration and leaves other configurations alone.
  - **Replace all configuration:** Replaces all configurations on the device.
  - **Do nothing:** Does not overwrite or change any existing configurations on the device.

![wifi options](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295547411)

Once the template is created, it will be available under the list of provisioning templates. You can download the config file and it will be available for deployment. Click **Download**, then **ChromeOS**.

![adding chromeos to provisioning template](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295552531)

Your configuration file will be "provisionting-template-<Your Template Name>.txt".

This file contains a JSON object. This is what you will need to set up auto-provisioning in the next step.

![Provisioning template .txt file open in a text editor, showing its one-line JSON with name, type and data values](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295553299)

<a id="ExtensionPolicy"></a>

### Adding to Extension Policy and Applying to OptiSigns Player

Now, go back to [**Google Admin**](http://admin.google.com) and navigate back to the **Apps & Extensions** menu.

Click the **OptiSigns extension**. Under Policy for extensions, paste the JSON from the provisioning-template.txt file you downloaded.

![optisigns provisioning id](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295555347)

Your JSON value will now appear in the field:

![optisigns provisioning json](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039280067219)

Then click **Save**.

Now your ChromeOS devices are provisioned. Your devices will pick up the policy at the next sync or restart. Follow our [**Getting Started**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/18823504383891-OptiSigns-Getting-Started-Guide)guide to pair the device in OptiSigns, upload content, then get your displays working!

## Adding OptiSigns Player to a Private Account

If you don't have a Google Admin account, you can still get the OptiSigns PWA to work on ChromeOS devices. Just follow these steps.
