### In this article, we will show you how to use Bonusly with OptiSigns Digital Signage.

Some companies use [Bonusly](bonus.ly) for internal communication channels and want to show the Messages sent between agents on signage across their work spaces.

The first step is to open a website app on your Optisigns account. Here is [how to use Website app](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016382473-How-to-use-a-Website-link-with-OptiSigns).

Copy this URL and paste in the URL section of your website app:
"https://bonus.ly/company/digital_signage?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN"

Next go to the Optisigns app and replace the "?access_token=xxxxx" code after the URL in the website app.

The whole URL SHOuld look something like this:
"https://bonus.ly/company/digital_signage?access_token=xxxxx"

Then click **Save**.

| **NOTE** |

| The portal Preview will say **Preview not available** because Bonusly blocks iframes. This is normal and will not affect the page displaying on your screen. |
