## Option 1: Upload a PowerPoint File

***We highly recommend this method!***

Depending on how you download your PowerPoint, this option can be useful if you want your videos, animations or transitions to work. You can either download your PowerPoint as:

- **A Video/MP4:** This **will play** any videos, transitions, or animations your PowerPoint may have.
- **A PPT File:** Videos, transitions, and animations will not play, but you can adjust the duration of slides.

**That said, let's get started!**

1. Download your PowerPoint to your device.
2. Log in to the **OptiSigns** portal.
3. Navigate to the **Files/Assets** page.
4. Click [**Upload Files**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016247974).
5. **Drag** in or **select** your PowerPoint file from your device.
6. Click **Upload**.
   **![Upload Files dialog with Quarterly-Update.pptx selected and the Upload 1 file button highlighted](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55936724803603)**
7. Either: **Assign** to a screen on the Screens Management page or **push** the asset to your screen.
   - If downloaded as a **PDF,** select the **Duration (seconds)**of the entire document. *(Min. 4/page)*

     ![Push To Screens dialog for a PDF, with the Duration (seconds) field highlighted](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55936724805139)

### Limitations

- Videos, transitions, and animations will not play if downloaded as a PDF or PPT file. It will just be a slideshow.

1. **Log in** to the OptiSigns portal.
2. Go to **Files/Assets**, then **Apps,** and search for the **PowerPoint Online** app.

## Best Practices for Using PowerPoint with OptiSigns

- **File Size:** Keep your PowerPoint file under **25MB** for optimal performance. Complete app size **cannot exceed 105MB**.
- **Avoid Embedded Videos:** Videos can increase file size and cause performance issues. Instead, consider exporting your presentation as a video if animations or video playback are essential.
- **Use Simple Transitions:** Complex animations and transitions may not render properly. Stick to basic transitions or upload a video version of your presentation if needed.

## FAQs

#### Why does using PowerPoint with OptiSigns require admin permission?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.

#### I want to log in to PowerPoint directly through my Microsoft account, but I don't see the option! What's going on?

If you're setting up the app but can't log in directly through Microsoft, you're likely logged on through a **Branded Portal.**

To use Microsoft single sign-on, sign in through [app.optisigns.com](http://app.optisigns.com) rather than your Branded Portal.

## That's it!

You've now successfully uploaded your PowerPoint file to OptiSigns!
